# MediaPipe Web Demo

First satisfy yourself that `index.html` contains code you are happy to run in your browser.

Then head over to [this page](https://davegreenwood.github.io/media-pipe-demo/) and allow your camera access.
If it runs OK, you will see yourself in a canvas.

It will take a few seconds to download the model, then a second window will show the holistic tracker over your camera view.
